- Forms and templates usually in regulations
- Both Act and Regulation must be verified

**3. Practical Application:**
- 7 days minimum is mandatory

- Can't contract out of requirements

**4. Cross-State Comparison:**
When advising on retail leases, always confirm:

- Verify current version as amendments are common
