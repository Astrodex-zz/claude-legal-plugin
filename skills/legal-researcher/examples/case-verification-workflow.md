## Step-by-Step Verification

### Step 1: Identify Case Precisely

**Initial Information:**
- Case name: *Donoghue v Stevenson*
- Known as landmark negligence case
- Established "neighbour principle"

**Verification Needed:**
- Full citation
- Court and jurisdiction
- Current legal standing

### Step 2: Access Primary Source (AustLII)

**Action:** Use WebFetch to access AustLII

**URL:** www.austlii.edu.au

**Search:** "Donoghue v Stevenson"

**Result Found:**
*Donoghue (or M'Alister) v Stevenson* [1932] AC 562; [1932] All ER Rep 1

**Court:** House of Lords (Privy Council for UK/Commonwealth appeals at the time)

**Date:** 26 May 1932

### Step 3: Read Full Judgment

**WebFetch:** Access full text at www.austlii.edu.au/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/100.html

**Key Findings:**

**The Facts:**
- Mrs Donoghue drank ginger beer containing a decomposed snail
- Bottle was opaque; manufacturer negligent in allowing snail into bottle
- No contract between Mrs Donoghue and manufacturer
- Question: Does manufacturer owe duty of care?

**The Ratio Decidendi (Lord Atkin):**
"You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be - persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question."

**Principle Established:**
The "neighbour principle" - foundation of modern negligence law

**Majority:** 3-2 decision
**Dissent:** Lords Buckmaster and Tomlin (technical grounds)

### Step 4: Check Judicial Consideration (AustLII)

**Action:** Click "Cases Citing This Case" on AustLII

**Result:** Cited in 1000+ cases

**Sample Recent Australian Treatment:**

1. **High Court of Australia cases:**
   - Cited and applied in numerous HCA decisions
   - *Sullivan v Moody* (2001) 207 CLR 562 - Applied neighbour principle
   - *Caltex Oil (Aust) Pty Ltd v The Dredge 'Willemstad'* (1976) 136 CLR 529 - Applied
   - Consistently treated as foundational authority

2. **Pattern of treatment:**
   - Universally accepted as cornerstone of negligence law
   - Never questioned or doubted by Australian courts
   - Applied in countless contexts
   - Principle refined and developed but never rejected

### Step 5: Cross-Check with Jade.io

**Action:** Access jade.io to verify judicial consideration

**CaseBase shows:**
- Applied: 500+ times
- Distinguished: Rarely (and only on narrow factual grounds)
- Overruled: Never
- Questioned: Never

**Treatment:** Universally positive, foundational authority

### Step 6: Verify Historical Context

**Note:** While this is a UK House of Lords case (1932), it has been adopted into Australian common law and is treated as binding authority by all Australian courts.

**Status in Australia:**
- Accepted as part of Australian common law
- Applied by High Court of Australia repeatedly
- Foundation of tort of negligence in Australia
- No Australian case has questioned its authority

### Step 7: Determine Current Status

**Current Status:** **Good Law - Foundational Authority**

**Basis:**
- Never overruled
- Consistently applied for 90+ years
- Foundation of negligence law
- Accepted by High Court of Australia
- No negative treatment identified
- Principle continually refined but core never questioned

**Qualifications:**
- Modern negligence law has added additional requirements (breach, causation, damages, remoteness)
- Principle of "reasonable foreseeability" developed further in subsequent cases
- Some contexts require additional policy considerations
- But core neighbour principle remains unchanged

### Step 8: Document Verification

## Lessons from This Example

**1. Even Well-Known Cases Must Be Verified**
- Don't assume a famous case is still good law
- Check judicial consideration for any negative treatment
- Verify principle hasn't been limited or overruled

**2. Read the Full Judgment**
- Understand the actual principle decided
- Don't rely on summaries or headnotes
- Identify ratio vs obiter

**3. Check Multiple Sources**
- AustLII for primary access
- Jade for comprehensive judicial consideration
- Cross-verify findings

**4. Document Thoroughly**
- Include all URLs checked
- Note verification date
- Record current status
- Include any qualifications

**5. Understand Historical Context**
- UK House of Lords case adopted into Australian law
- Treatment in Australian courts is what matters
- Historical significance doesn't guarantee current validity (but in this case, it's foundational)

This workflow demonstrates the complete verification process from initial question through to documented, verified citation ready for use in legal work.
