# Jade.io Research Guide

## Overview

Jade.io (www.jade.io) is an Australian legal research platform that provides enhanced case law research with superior judicial consideration tools. While some features require a subscription, Jade offers powerful citation analysis beyond what's available on free platforms.

## Key Features

### Superior Judicial Consideration

**Why Jade Excels:**
- More comprehensive citation linking than AustLII
- Visual representation of case relationships
- Detailed analysis of how cases treat each other
- Citation mapping shows influence over time
- Faster updates for recent cases

### CaseBase

Jade's CaseBase feature provides:
- Every time a case has been judicially considered
- Treatment classification (applied, distinguished, etc.)
- Quotes showing exactly how the case was discussed
- Links to full text of citing cases
- Chronological and relevance sorting

## When to Use Jade vs AustLII

## Using Jade for Judicial Consideration

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Locate the Case**
- Search by case name or citation
- Verify you have the correct decision
- Check jurisdiction and court

**2. Access CaseBase**
- Look for "CaseBase" or "Judicial Consideration" section
- This shows all times the case has been cited

**3. Review Treatment Categories**

**Positive Authority:**
- **Applied**: Court followed the reasoning and reached similar conclusion
- **Approved**: Court expressly endorsed the legal principle
- **Adopted**: Court accepted and incorporated the reasoning
- **Followed**: Court adhered to the precedent

**Neutral/Explanatory:**
- **Considered**: Court examined the case in detail
- **Discussed**: Court analyzed various aspects
- **Explained**: Court clarified the principle
- **Referred to**: Case mentioned, often for background

**Negative/Limiting:**
- **Distinguished**: Court found facts materially different, didn't apply
- **Doubted**: Court questioned the correctness of reasoning
- **Not followed**: Court declined to apply the principle
- **Overruled**: Court explicitly rejected the authority (CRITICAL FINDING)
- **Disapproved**: Higher court criticized the decision

**4. Read Key Citations**

For each citation shown:
- Click through to read the full context
- Verify the treatment classification is accurate
- Note the level of court (High Court treatment most significant)
- Check the date (recent treatment more relevant)

**5. Identify Patterns**

- Is the case consistently applied or distinguished?
- What types of situations does it apply to?
- Has treatment changed over time?
- Are there competing lines of authority?

**6. Check High Court Treatment**

**CRITICAL STEP:**
- Filter or sort for High Court citations
- High Court can overrule any other Australian court
- High Court interpretation is authoritative
- Even if HCA only "considered" the case, read it carefully

## Visual Tools

### Citation Map

Shows graphical representation of:
- Cases cited by this decision
- Cases citing this decision
- Relationships between cases in the chain
- Temporal flow of authority

**How to Use:**
- Identify influential authorities
- Trace development of legal principle
- Find related cases in same area
- Spot where authority diverges

### Treatment Visualization

Color-coded or graphical display showing:
- Proportion of positive vs negative treatment
- Trends over time
- Court level distribution
- Jurisdiction patterns

## Advanced Search Features

### Precise Citation Search

- More sophisticated than AustLII
- Better at finding partial citations
- Handles alternative citation formats
- Links between different reported citations

### Full Text Search with Context

- Search within judgments
- Preview context before opening case
- Highlight search terms in results
- More refined relevance ranking

### Judge and Counsel Search

- Find all cases by particular judge
- Track specific counsel's arguments
- Useful for understanding judicial approach
- Identify expertise patterns

## Best Practices for Using Jade

### Verification Protocol

1. **Find case on Jade**
2. **Review CaseBase in full**
3. **Sort by date (most recent first)**
4. **Filter for High Court and Court of Appeal**
5. **Read any negative treatment in full**
6. **Cross-check with AustLII** if discrepancies
7. **Document both sources checked**

### Documentation

When using Jade, record:
- URL to case on Jade
- Date accessed
- CaseBase treatment summary
- Any critical subsequent decisions
- Whether full subscription access used

### Limitations to Note

**Jade is Not Perfect:**
- Treatment classifications sometimes debatable
- Very recent cases may not show all citations yet
- Some historical links may be incomplete
- Subscription required for full features

**Always Verify:**
- Read citing cases yourself, don't rely solely on classification
- Check what Jade categorizes as "distinguished" or "not followed"
- Context matters - same case might be applied in one context, distinguished in another

## Integration with Multi-Source Verification

### Recommended Workflow

**For Critical Cases:**
1. **AustLII**: Find case, read full text
2. **Jade**: Check comprehensive judicial consideration via CaseBase
3. **AustLII**: Cross-verify any concerning citations
4. **Court Website**: Confirm with direct source for recent citations

**For Routine Cases:**
1. **AustLII**: Find and verify case
2. **AustLII**: Check "Cases Citing This Case"
3. **Jade**: Only if AustLII shows potential issues or for extra thoroughness

**For High-Stakes Work:**
- Always use both Jade and AustLII
- Cross-check any discrepancies
- Read all High Court treatments in full
- Document verification from both sources

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Case Appears Overruled

**What Jade Shows:**
- "Overruled" or "Not followed" in CaseBase
- Citing case from Court of Appeal or High Court
- Recent treatment (last 5-10 years)

**What to Do:**
1. Read the citing case in full (critical!)
2. Confirm it actually overrules the principle, not just distinguishes on facts
3. Check if overruling has itself been confirmed or questioned
4. Verify on AustLII as well
5. Document clearly in verification output

### Scenario 2: Heavy Citation with Mixed Treatment

**What Jade Shows:**
- Case cited many times
- Mix of "applied", "distinguished", "considered"
- Spanning many years

**What to Do:**
1. Sort by date (recent first)
2. Filter by court level (High Court and appellate)
3. Look for patterns - is it being applied in certain contexts, distinguished in others?
4. Read recent appellate decisions to understand current status
5. Provide nuanced assessment in verification output

### Scenario 3: Very Recent Case

**What Jade Shows:**
- Few or no citations yet
- Limited CaseBase information

**What to Do:**
1. Can still cite as current authority
2. Note it hasn't been judicially considered yet
3. Monitor for future treatment
4. Check court website to confirm it's final (not subject to appeal)
5. Flag that status may change as case law develops

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Jade

**Solutions:**
1. Use AustLII for all verification
2. Check court websites for recent cases
3. Note in verification output that Jade was not accessible
4. Consider stating "verification limited to AustLII"

### Jade and AustLII Show Different Results

**Possible Reasons:**
- Update timing differences
- Classification differences
- Database completeness variations

**Resolution:**
1. Read the actual citing cases yourself
2. Make your own assessment of treatment
3. Document the discrepancy
4. Use the more conservative interpretation
5. When in doubt, state both sources and note the difference

### Case Not on Jade

**Some Cases Missing:**
- Very recent (not yet uploaded)
- Lower court unreported decisions
- Some tribunal decisions

**Solution:**
- Rely on AustLII
- Check court website
- Note Jade was checked but case not available

## Key Advantages Summary

**Jade Excels At:**
1. Comprehensive judicial consideration tracking
2. Visual representation of citation relationships
3. Detailed treatment classification
4. Quick identification of overruling or negative treatment
5. Recent case updates

**AustLII Excels At:**
1. Free access for all users
2. Broad coverage including tribunals
3. Legislation research
4. Historical materials
5. Official versions

**Best Approach:**
Use both where possible. Jade for superior judicial consideration analysis, AustLII for free access and legislation, court websites for very recent materials. Document all sources checked.
