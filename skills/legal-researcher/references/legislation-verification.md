# Legislation Verification Guide

## Overview

Verifying legislation requires confirming you have the current, in-force version with exact wording, correct jurisdiction, and up-to-date amendment history. This guide covers Commonwealth and all State/Territory sources.

## Jurisdiction Identification

### First Step: Determine Correct Jurisdiction

**Commonwealth Powers:**
- Constitutional matters (s 51 of Constitution)
- Corporations law
- Taxation
- Immigration
- Bankruptcy
- Copyright and patents
- Interstate trade
- Banking
- Telecommunications

**State/Territory Powers:**
- Property and conveyancing
- Contract law (except corporations)
- Criminal law (except Commonwealth offenses)
- Planning and development
- Retail leases and tenancies
- Personal injury and negligence
- Succession and estates
- Most regulatory matters

**Concurrent Powers:**
Some areas have both Commonwealth and State legislation:
- Consumer law (ACL is Commonwealth, applied by States)
- Employment (Fair Work is Commonwealth, but States have some roles)
- Environment (overlapping jurisdiction)

**When in Doubt:**
- Check which parliament passed the Act
- Look at the full title and year
- Verify jurisdiction in first few sections
- Consider constitutional validity

## Commonwealth Legislation Verification

### Primary Source: legislation.gov.au

**Federal Register of Legislation:**
- Official source for Commonwealth Acts and instruments
- Authoritative version
- Includes compilations and point-in-time versions

**Access:**
1. Navigate to www.legislation.gov.au
2. Search by Act title or use A-Z browse
3. Verify you have the correct Act (check full title and year)

**Key Features:**

**"Series" Page:**
- Shows all versions of the Act
- Current compilation (most recent)
- Historical compilations
- Original (as enacted)

**"Current" Version:**
- Latest compilation incorporating all amendments to date
- "Compilation date" shown at top
- This is what you should cite unless doing historical research

**"Compilation Details":**
- Tables showing amendments
- Which Acts amended this one
- When amendments commenced
- What sections were affected

### Verification Steps for Commonwealth Acts

**1. Locate the Act:**
- Search on legislation.gov.au
- Verify title, year, and Act number
- Confirm you're in correct series

**2. Open Current Compilation:**
- Click on most recent compilation
- Check "compilation date" at top of document
- This shows law as at that date

**3. Find Your Section:**
- Use table of contents
- Navigate to specific section
- Read in full context (don't just read provision in isolation)

**4. Verify Exact Wording:**
- Copy exact text including:
  - Section number
  - Subsection, paragraph, subparagraph markers
  - Any notes or definitions
  - Penalty provisions if relevant

**5. Check Amendment History:**
- Scroll to end notes
- Find "Table of Amendments"
- Check when section was:
  - Inserted (if not original)
  - Amended (what changes and when)
  - Repealed (if applicable)

**6. Check Commencement:**
- Look at commencement provisions (usually s 2)
- Verify provision is actually in force
- Note any delayed commencement
- Check proclamations if commencement by proclamation

**7. Note Version Information:**
- Record compilation number
- Record "as at" date
- Note this for citation

**8. Cross-Check with AustLII:**
- Optional but recommended
- AustLII may have additional annotations
- Provides cross-database linking
- Good for finding related cases

## Cross-Jurisdictional Verification

### When Law Applies Across States

**Example: Australian Consumer Law**
- Enacted by Commonwealth (Competition and Consumer Act 2010)
- Applied by each State/Territory via application Acts
- Check both Commonwealth and relevant State application

**Retail Leases:**
- Each State has different Act:
  - NSW: Retail Leases Act 1994
  - VIC: Retail Leases Act 2003
  - QLD: Retail Shop Leases Act 1994
  - SA: Retail and Commercial Leases Act 1995
  - WA: Commercial Tenancy (Retail Shops) Agreements Act 1985
- Provisions differ significantly - verify correct State

**Corporations Law:**
- Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) is Commonwealth
- Applied in States via Corporations (Commonwealth Powers) Acts
- Primarily Commonwealth jurisdiction

### Avoiding Jurisdictional Errors

Common mistakes:
- Citing NSW Act when VIC matter
- Citing old State law that's been replaced by Commonwealth law
- Confusing similarly-named Acts from different States
- Not checking if Commonwealth law applies

Always verify:
- Where did the matter arise?
- Which jurisdiction's law applies?
- Is there choice of law clause in contract?
- Constitutional considerations?

## Amendment History Analysis

### Why Amendment History Matters

Amendments can:
- Change meaning completely
- Add exceptions or qualifications
- Repeal provisions
- Alter definitions
- Affect transitional arrangements

### Reading Amendment Tables

**Typical Format:**
```
Section 42 — amended by:
  Act No. 15 of 2020, s 8, commenced 1 July 2020
  Act No. 23 of 2018, s 15, commenced 1 March 2019
Section 42A — inserted by:
  Act No. 15 of 2020, s 9, commenced 1 July 2020
```

**What to Note:**
- When was provision first inserted?
- How many times has it been amended?
- What is the most recent amendment?
- Are amendments substantial or minor?

### Transitional Provisions

**Critical for Historical Matters:**
- Old law may still apply to pre-amendment situations
- Check transitional and savings provisions
- Usually in amending Act or Schedule
- Determines which version of law applies to your matter

**Example:**
If provision amended 1 January 2023, but your transaction was 1 December 2022, you need pre-amendment version.

## Point-in-Time Verification

### When You Need Historical Version

**Scenarios:**
- Reviewing old contracts
- Assessing historical compliance
- Checking what law was at time of transaction
- Determining whether action was lawful when taken

### How to Access Historical Versions

**Commonwealth (legislation.gov.au):**
- "Series" page shows all compilations
- Select compilation current at your date
- Note compilation covers period from X to Y

**States:**
Most state sites allow point-in-time viewing:
- Select "view as at date" option
- Enter your required date
- System shows version in force at that date

**If Historical Version Not Online:**
- May need to consult hard copy law reports
- Check law library
- Some older versions only in print
- Note limitation in your verification

## Subordinate Legislation

### Regulations, Rules, and Instruments

Don't forget to check:
- Regulations made under the Act
- Rules, orders, determinations
- Proclamations (for commencement)
- Ministerial instruments

**These can be as important as the Act itself:**
- Provide detailed requirements
- Can be amended more easily than Acts
- May contain relevant definitions
- Often specify procedures or forms

**Verification:**
Same process as for Acts:
- Check current version
- Verify amendment history
- Confirm in force
- Note version information

## Common Pitfalls

### Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using Outdated Version**
   - Not checking "as at" date
   - Assuming old printout is current
   - Not reviewing amendment history

2. **Wrong Jurisdiction**
   - Citing NSW law for VIC matter
   - Not checking which State law applies
   - Confusing Commonwealth vs State

3. **Incomplete Citation**
   - Not noting subsection or paragraph
   - Forgetting to include year
   - Omitting jurisdiction for State Acts

4. **Ignoring Definitions**
   - Not checking defined terms
   - Assuming ordinary meaning
   - Missing dictionary provisions

5. **Missing Related Provisions**
   - Reading provision in isolation
   - Not checking exceptions
   - Ignoring transitional provisions
