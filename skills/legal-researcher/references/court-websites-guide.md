## Using Court Websites Effectively

### Verification Workflow

**For Recent Cases (Last 3 Months):**

1. **Start with court website**
   - Most likely to have very recent decisions
   - Official version
   - May include information not yet on databases

2. **Cross-check with AustLII**
   - Confirm case has been added
   - Check for any annotations or links

3. **Check Jade if available**
   - See if any early judicial consideration
   - Though usually too recent for citations

**For Older Cases:**

1. **Start with AustLII or Jade**
   - Better search and navigation
   - Judicial consideration tools
   - Cross-linking with other cases

2. **Confirm with court website if needed**
   - Verify specific details
   - Get official version
   - Check for any subsequent orders

### Finding Cases by Citation

If you have a citation like [2024] NSWSC 123:

1. **Identify the court code**:
   - NSWSC = NSW Supreme Court
   - FCA = Federal Court of Australia
   - HCA = High Court of Australia
   - VSC = Victoria Supreme Court
   - etc.

2. **Navigate to that court's website**

3. **Search by citation or browse by year**

4. **Locate and download judgment**

### Checking Appeal Status

**On High Court Website:**
- Check "Applications for Special Leave"
- Search by party name or lower court citation
- See if appeal granted, refused, or pending

**On State Court Websites:**
- Some courts list pending appeals
- Check "Court Lists" or "Hearing Lists"
- Note if "on appeal" appears in case metadata

**Important:**
If a case is subject to appeal, note this limitation when citing it. It may be overturned or varied.

## Specific Navigation Tips

### High Court (hcourt.gov.au)

**Best Path:**
Cases → Recent Decisions → [Select Year] → Browse or Search

**Pro Tips:**
- Media summaries easier to understand than full judgments
- Check "Transcripts" for oral hearing transcripts
- "Special Leave Applications" shows what cases HCA considering

### Federal Court (fedcourt.gov.au)

**Best Path:**
Judgments → Search or Browse by Date

**Pro Tips:**
- Updated same day or next day usually
- PDF format standard
- Can browse by judge name
- Note Federal Circuit and Family Court also listed here

### NSW Supreme Court (supremecourt.justice.nsw.gov.au)

**Best Path:**
Caselaw → Search

**Pro Tips:**
- Separate sections for Court of Appeal vs first instance
- Good search functionality
- Many judgments have catchwords
- Cross-links to AustLII

### Other State Courts

**General Approach:**
1. Find "Judgments" or "Decisions" section (usually in main menu)
2. Look for search or browse options
3. Filter by date if available
4. May need to check both PDF and HTML formats

**Common Issues:**
- Some states have less intuitive interfaces
- Search may be limited
- Very recent cases may take days to appear
- Older archives may not be complete

## Troubleshooting

### Case Not on Court Website

**Possible Reasons:**
- Case too old (pre-digital era)
- Unreported decision (court chose not to publish)
- Too recent (not yet uploaded)
- Lower court decision (may not be published)

**Solutions:**
- Check AustLII (may have it)
- Try Jade
- Check if case was actually reported
- For old cases, may need physical law reports

### Website Down or Inaccessible

**Alternatives:**
- Use AustLII as primary source
- Try cached version (Google Cache)
- Check back later (court websites sometimes have maintenance)
- Use Jade if available

### Can't Find Search Function

**Some Court Websites Have Poor Search:**
- Browse by date if search unavailable
- Use site-specific Google search: site:supremecourt.vic.gov.au "case name"
- Check if cases archived elsewhere (some link to AustLII)
- Contact court library for assistance

## Best Practices

### When to Rely on Court Websites

**Appropriate:**
- Very recent cases (last few weeks)
- When you need official version for filing
- Checking for appeals or subsequent orders
- When AustLII/Jade don't have the case yet

**Supplement with AustLII/Jade:**
- For judicial consideration
- For better search across cases
- For cases more than 3 months old
- When doing comprehensive research

### Documentation

When using court website, record:
- Full URL to judgment
- Date accessed
- Court and citation
- Note that it's official court version

### Regular Checks

For matters you're monitoring:
- Check court website weekly for updates
- Sign up for alerts if court offers them
- Monitor appeals lists
- Track subsequent orders or variations

## Integration with Overall Verification Strategy

Court websites are one part of multi-source verification:

1. **AustLII**: Primary research tool
2. **Jade**: Judicial consideration analysis
3. **Court Websites**: Recent cases and official versions
4. **State Legislation Sites**: Official statutory text

Use court websites strategically:
- For time-sensitive matters
- When very recent authority needed
- To verify official citations
- To check appeal status

But rely on AustLII and Jade for:
- Comprehensive searching
- Judicial consideration
- Older cases
- Cross-database research

By combining all these sources, you ensure thorough, accurate legal verification.
