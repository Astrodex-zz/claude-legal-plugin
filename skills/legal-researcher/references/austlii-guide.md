## Judicial Consideration Tools

### Cases Citing This Case

**How to Access:**
1. Open the case you want to check
2. Look for "Cases Citing This Case" link (usually near top or bottom)
3. Review list of subsequent cases

**What to Look For:**

**Positive Treatment:**
- "Applied" - Court followed the reasoning
- "Approved" - Court endorsed the principle
- "Followed" - Court adopted the same approach
- "Adopted" - Court accepted the reasoning

**Neutral Treatment:**
- "Considered" - Court examined the case
- "Discussed" - Court analyzed the case
- "Referred to" - Court mentioned the case
- "Cited" - Case referenced without detailed analysis

**Negative Treatment:**
- "Distinguished" - Court found facts different, didn't follow
- "Not followed" - Court declined to apply reasoning
- "Doubted" - Court questioned the reasoning
- "Overruled" - Court explicitly rejected the case (CRITICAL)
- "Departed from" - Court chose different approach

### Reading Judicial Consideration

**Priority Order for Review:**
1. **High Court decisions** - Highest authority
2. **Full Court/Court of Appeal** - Appellate level
3. **First instance** - Single judge decisions

**Critical Analysis:**
- How many times has the case been cited?
- Is citation increasing or decreasing over time?
- What is the pattern of treatment?
- Any High Court treatment since decision?
- Has the legal landscape changed?
